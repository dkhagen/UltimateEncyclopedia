# UltimateEncyclopedia

This is an Android application written in Kotlin that utilizes various technologies such as Room, Glide, Retrofit, and others to provide users with detailed information on Super Smash Brothers Ultimate fighters. The app downloads data from a simple REST Api I created using json-server that serves all of the data needed in the app. This data is downloaded and stored and automatically redownloads if the remote JSON is updated. Users can then see and search fighters, see all of their moves, see hitboxes for their moves, and mark favorites. 

This was written as a personal project by myself with no affiliation with anyone or any corporation.
